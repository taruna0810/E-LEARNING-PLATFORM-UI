*THIS PROJECT IS A FRONT-END DESIGN FOR AN E-LEARNING PLATFORM, DEVELOPED USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT TO CREATE A VISUALLY APPEALING, USER-FRIENDLY, AND RESPONSIVE MULTI-PAGE INTERFACE. THE PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE ONLINE EDUCATION BY PROVIDING AN INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE USERS CAN VIEW COURSE LISTINGS, TRACK THEIR PROGRESS, AND ACCESS EMBEDDED VIDEO CONTENT FOR EACH MODULE. THE INTERFACE FEATURES A MODERN, CLEAN LAYOUT WITH CARD-BASED COURSE REPRESENTATIONS THAT INCLUDE COURSE TITLES, BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS, PROGRESS BARS INDICATING COURSE COMPLETION STATUS, AND A BUTTON TO "WATCH VIDEO" CONTENT. EACH COURSE CARD ALLOWS USERS TO EASILY UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT AT A GLANCE AND CONTINUE LEARNING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF.*

*THE TOOLS USED IN BUILDING THIS PLATFORM INCLUDE HTML5 FOR STRUCTURE, CSS3 FOR STYLING, AND JAVASCRIPT FOR INTERACTIVITY AND FUNCTIONALITY SUCH AS DYNAMIC PROGRESS TRACKING. CSS FLEXBOX AND GRID SYSTEMS WERE UTILIZED TO ENSURE RESPONSIVENESS ACROSS DEVICES, ENSURING A SEAMLESS USER EXPERIENCE ON DESKTOPS, TABLETS, AND MOBILE PHONES. CUSTOM COLORS AND GRADIENTS WERE USED TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL LOOK, AND ROUNDED CONTAINERS WITH DROP SHADOWS WERE APPLIED TO MAKE THE INTERFACE VISUALLY COMFORTABLE AND ENGAGING. THE PLATFORM ALSO USES RESPONSIVE TYPOGRAPHY AND BUTTON COMPONENTS TO ENHANCE ACCESSIBILITY AND NAVIGATION.*

*THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE SKILLS IN FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT AND UI/UX DESIGN WHILE ADDRESSING PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS IN EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY. IT SHOWCASES HOW SIMPLE TOOLS CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY TO BUILD A FUNCTIONAL AND ATTRACTIVE USER INTERFACE.*
